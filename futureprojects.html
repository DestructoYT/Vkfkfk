    <h1>Making A Project</h1>

    <p>Creating a project could be fun but some times stressful activity</p>
    <p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great projects.</p>

    <p class="top-tip">If You Dont Have Alot Of Time Dont Do A Project</p>

    <h2>Copy/Fork A Project</h2>
    <p>
      Another person's<strong>project</strong> is good for preview and you can develop on that
    </p>
    <p>Invite everyone.</p>
    <p>
      Must have a <strong>Team</strong> else you aren't gonna pull it off by yoself
    </p>

    <h2>Remember your backups.</h2>
    <p>
      Some parts of your project might be at the risk of getting accidentally deleted.Make <strong>BACKUPS</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Plan where you'll be on the stage.</h2>
    <p>
      Before you start to set up your instruments, take a few minutes to decide
      where you're all going to be.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will the drums be centre stage? Or off to one side?</li>
      <li>
        Is there a power-socket for the amplifier if your guitar player stands
        on the right?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> your
      start setting up your instruments. It's really annoying if you have to
      start unplugging things and swapping places once you've begun to set
      things up!
    </p>
    <h2>Know where you're going, know when you're on.</h2>
    <p>
      If you're playing a concert somewhere you've never been before make sure
      you know where it is. Print out a map or set the sat nav before you set
      out. There's nothing worse than being lost in an unfamiliar place
      half-an-hour before you're due to go on-stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you do arrive, the first thing you should do is
      <strong> find out what time you're on</strong>. On the night times often
      change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Don't get
      caught out!
