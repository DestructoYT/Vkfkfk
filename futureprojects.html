    <h1>Making A Project</h1>

    <p>Creating a project could be fun but some times stressful activity</p>
    <p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great projects.</p>

    <p class="top-tip">
      If You <strong> DONT </strong>Have Alot Of Time <strong>DONT </strong>Do A
      Project
    </p>

    <h2>Copy/Fork A Project</h2>
    <p>
      Another person's <strong>project</strong> is good for preview and you can
      develop on top of that
    </p>
    <p>Invite everyone.</p>
    <p>
      Must have a <strong>Team</strong> else you aren't gonna pull it off by
      yoself
    </p>

    <h2>Remember your backups.</h2>
    <p>
      Some parts of your project might be at the risk of getting accidentally
      deleted.Make <strong>BACKUPS</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Plan what you'll be doing.</h2>
    <p>Before you start your project, organise who is going to do what.</p>

    <p>
      It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you
      start, it's very frustrating if you have to start again.
    </p>
    <h2>Know what you're doing, know why are you doing it.</h2>
    <p>
      If you are using new code alway practice before trying to code with it. It
      may not work.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when you do start, the first thing you should do is
      <strong> find out where do you start</strong>. Roles may change as your
      starting a project. Ask the leader of your group.
